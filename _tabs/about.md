I am Dania, a Malaysian student studying Software Convergence at Kyung Hee University, Korea. My interests and hobbies include writing, music, reading, and photography.

I started studying computer science from Form 4, where I took the computer science track for the Malaysian Certificate of Education (SPM) and was interested in pursuing it further at the tertiary level.
