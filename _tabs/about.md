I'm Dania, a final year student at Kyung Hee University double majoring in Software Convergence (specialising in the Data Science track) and Space Science. I am currently an undergraduate researcher in the Language and Data Intelligence (LDI) Lab where I explore my interest in NLP. My research interests include text simplification, machine translation and hallucination.
